+ Sample1
  This is the basic sample of C_lang,and it teaches you how to print sth on your screen.
  >Code
  ```
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  int main(){
  /* Although the better form is:
   int main()
   {
      return 0;
   }
   I get used to using that form 
   because of Java
  */
  printf("HelloWorld\n");
  return 0;
  }
  ```
